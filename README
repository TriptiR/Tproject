	The application FARE ESTIMATOR ,as the name suggests calculates the
	estimated fare of a trip and displays it as the output.The user has the provision
	to choose the Mode of Transport. IT requires the user to enter the 
	starting point and the destination point.

	This application makes use of the Graph Data structure.It has the names 
	of the cities as the nodes and the mode of transport as the edge.
	respective edges are created it a ceratin mode of transport could be followed.
	the graph here is stored in the form of adjacency lists.
	it then uses the modified dijkshtra's algorithm to calculate the shortest
	distance and thus this distance is used in aspecefic formula to calculate the 
	fares.

	This application is of use in practical life and I hope that it hepls you.
